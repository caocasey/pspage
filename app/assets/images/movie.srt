Hi, my name is Yingxi,

2
00:00:02,498 --> 00:00:07,497
I studied in Beijing University of Technology as an undergraduatestudent in computer science.

3
00:00:07,957 --> 00:00:11,957
During the time in Beijing, I got consecutive Learning MeritScholarships.

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,559
And be selected as an exchange student to study in ECE Paris.

5
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:20,895
During the time inParis, I did a lot of projects working with data,

6
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:24,051
For example our startup project in school.

7
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:30,051
The goal of this project is to allow clients shopping in market without needing the help ofassistant.

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:36,080
What he needs is just a smartphone application in order to scan product and payonline.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,080
As for me I did the ruby on rails server for data management storage and exchange,

10
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:46,165
I found that working with data is very interesting and I would like to continue working on it.

11
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:53,395
What’s more, I also did two internships in France, one in UNESCO and the other in  PSA,

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,480
From these 2 internships, I got deeper understanding of how tocooperate with team members in the same project,

13
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,725
and I learnt many innovative ideas.

14
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:09,725
Finally, I got my master degree in this engineer school and acquired many practical skills.

15
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:17,406
I have been in New York in 2013 to visit my host family after finished my summer study in UCI.

16
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:23,519
I found that there are plenty of opportunities in New York since its location priorities.

17
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:31,519
My host sister live in Brooklyn, we first met each other in Beijing during high school timesince she came to study Chinese.

18
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:38,697
Nearly 10 years passed, she came to China to teach as avolunteer and I went to US to study,

19
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:46,697
If I could be selected to study in NYU then it’s really agood chance to visit them again and to better maintain this friendship.

20
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:54,768
After attained a master Degree, I would like to work in an international IT company,

21
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:59,117
which can provides me opportunity to use both my networking knowledge,

22
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:01,536
and communication skills.

23
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:08,014
I see myself developed my management skills during the training program offered byuniversity.

24
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:11,686
So after working for few years, accumulate experience,

25
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:15,075
my goal is to develop myself in leadership area,

26
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:23,075
which can help me better understand the architecture ofenterprise and the management principles.

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,009
Laying the foundation for my future career.

28
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:29,290
Finally, I would like to start my own business.

29
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,290
Since I have multiple international backgrounds,

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,200
I will make full use of the knowledge I learnt in different countries,

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,801
get ready to grow in frustration and learn from mistakes.

32
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:44,801
Developing myself, get myself stronger day by day,

33
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:49,291
and do my best to make my company as a fortune 500 in the last.

34
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,890
Thank you for watching, I do hope that I could be selected to NYU

35
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:58,642
Merci beaucoup(Thank you so much), Au-revoir(Bye) :)
